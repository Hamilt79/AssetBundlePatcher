# AssetBundlePatcher

Small application made with [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/avaloniaui/avalonia).
It is very Barren because it was originally made as a tool to help me debug a specific Unity game, but I don't want people to use it that way so it is heavily reduced and has limited features.

# Features

1. View Unity asset bundle contents
2. Edit parts of asset bundles (limited)
3. Overwrite asset bundle with edited version
4. View bundle as if it were a Unity scene (hierarchy view)

# Reqs

Include [AssetTools.NET](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET) library as a dependency.

Apologies for the censor, but I did not want identifying factors in the image.
